- `model_evaluator.py`: Evaluate models using various metrics
- `model_comparison.py`: Compare model performance
- `main.py`: Main script to run the training pipeline

## Usage

```bash
python module2_model_training/main.py
```

## Output
- Trained models saved to `models/` directory
- Evaluation reports and metrics
- Best model selected and saved

## Target Metrics
- Accuracy: > 90%
