# Module 2: Machine Learning Model Training & Evaluation

## Overview

This module implements the machine learning model training pipeline, evaluation framework, and comparative analysis for fake job posting classification.

## Components

- `model_trainer.py`: Model training implementation for Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers
- `model_evaluator.py`: Evaluation metrics calculation and reporting
- `main.py`: Main training and evaluation pipeline execution script

## Execution

```bash
python module2_model_training/main.py
```

## Output Artifacts

- Trained model files in `models/` directory
- Evaluation metrics and performance reports
- Best performing model selection and serialization

## Performance Targets

- Classification Accuracy: ≥ 90%
- F1-Score: Balanced precision-recall performance
